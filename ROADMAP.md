  - [ ] Search implementation for the Front End
  - [ ] APIKEY
  - [ ] API query limitation
  - [ ] Refresh Token
  - [ ] Improve and Clean Dockerfile and docker-compose
  - [ ] Define test, production and development environments
  - [ ] Document route calls
  - [ ] Add more unit tests
  - [ ] Add explanatory docstring on all routes
- FrontEnd
  - [ ] Define responsive layout
  - [ ] Fill with Sonic Lightweight
  - [ ] Icons
  - [ ] Check dimensioning in the main browsers
  - [ ] Menus
  - [ ] Add preview links
- File manager
  - [ ] The name of the file in the database and search
  - [ ] Modified date/time
  - [ ] Store/display statistics of the uploaded file
  - [ ] Subsequent uploads
  - [ ] Generic Toolbar
  - [ ] Buttons for note entries and selections
  - [ ] Add extraction via PDF
  - [ ] Add movement of notes via drag

## BUSINESS RULES

- [ ] When returning the notes should be smart enough to return by priority
- [ ] Create validations:
  - [ ] You cannot create a note with done
  - [ ] You cannot update the creation date
  - [ ] I couldn't delete a note until I did it
- [ ] Each user will have only one to-do list

## ANALYSIS

- [ ] Use tutorial [Importando arquivos JSON para Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/lots-of-json-29873d3abfdf), to give a get all in the base and format the separated data to create models
- [ ] See implementation of a separate front, similar to [Ferramenta de teste de dados estruturados](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool)
- [ ] If possible test Sklearn to test [Similaridade entre coment√°rios](https://medium.com/@octaviofisica/similaridade-entre-coment%C3%A1rios-20d1812b6dc4)
- [ ] When separating the URL's, test the [micawber](https://github.com/coleifer/micawber), 
to extract value from the URL's
- [ ] After defining and structuring the data, apply techniques as [Machine Learning for Cybersecurity 101](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-for-cybersecurity-101-7822b802790b)
